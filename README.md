# BankOfHussein
Literally functions like a bank. Can create your own account and have it send you emails (check spam if not received). To run:
1. Create a new project named "BankOfHussein" in a Python IDE of your choice
2. Add the "Main.py", "Email.py", and "Bank.py" to your project directory
3. Run the "Main.py" file

# Important Note
User data is saved locally to a file named "people.txt". It is important that when you first run the program, you create an account, then restart the program in order for the file to update. For all future accounts added, this is not needed as the file is already created.
